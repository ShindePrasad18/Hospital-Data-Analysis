HOSPITAL DATA ANALYSIS

Problems We solved in this Project :
1. Demographic Analysis
    * Calculate the average age of patients by gender.
    * Find the distribution of patients across different states (count per state).
    * Identify the top 5 cities with the most patients.
2. Age Group Analysis
    * Categorize patients into age groups (e.g., 0-18, 19-35, 36-50, 51-65, 65+) and count the number of patients in each group.
    * Compare the gender distribution within each age group.
3. Email Domain Analysis
    * Extract the domain from the email addresses (e.g., datacourse.com) and count how many patients use each domain.
    * Are there any invalid or unusual email domains?
4. State and City Insights
    * Which state has the highest number of patients?
    * For the state with the most patients, what is the most common city?
5. Duplicate or Unique Patients
    * Check if there are any duplicate PatientID or PatientNumber entries.
    * Are there patients with the same first and last name? If so, how many?
6. Age and Gender Correlation
    * Is there a correlation between age and gender in this dataset? (e.g., are females generally older than males?)
7. Outlier Detection
    * Are there any patients with unusually high or low ages (e.g., age > 100 or age < 1)?
    * How many patients are under 18 years old?
8. Name Analysis
    * What are the top 5 most common first names?
    * What are the top 5 most common last names?
9. Missing Data Check
    * Are there any missing values in the dataset? If so, in which columns?
10. Advanced: Patient Clustering
    * Use clustering (e.g., K-means) to group patients based on age and location (state/city).
